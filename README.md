###### Memory

The ATmega2560 has 256 KB of flash memory for storing code (of which 8 KB is used for the bootloader), 8 KB of SRAM
and 4 KB of EEPROM (which can be read and written with the EEPROM library).

###### Power Pins

- VIN - The input voltage to the Arduino board when it's using an external power source (as opposed to 5 volts from the
USB connection or other regulated power source). You can supply voltage through this pin, or, if supplying voltage via
the power jack, access it through this pin.
- 5V - This pin outputs a regulated 5V from the regulator on the board. The board can be supplied with power either
from the DC power jack (7 - 12V), the USB connector (5V), or the VIN pin of the board (7-12V). Supplying voltage via
the 5V or 3.3V pins bypasses the regulator, and can damage your board. We don't advise it.
- 3V3 - A 3.3 volt supply generated by the on-board regulator. Maximum current draw is 50 mA.
- GND - Ground pins
